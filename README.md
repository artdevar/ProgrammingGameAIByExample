These are sources from Programming Game AI By Example by Mat Buckland's book. 

Since the link in the book is invalid, thanks to [wangchen](https://github.com/wangchen) we have them: [link](https://github.com/wangchen/Programming-Game-AI-by-Example-src).

I adapted the code for the modern Visual Studio 2022 environment. 

A little guide: 
1) Open the ProgrammingGameAIByExample.sln file in the Visual Studio;
2) Choose the project you want to play and choose "Set as Startup Project" option in a Solution Explorer window ([Tip](https://imgur.com/a/sihd0Uj).
3) Run.

The project will be completed in a few days.
